# lein-script

A Leiningen template for creating project-free scripts in Clojure.

You must add [lein-exec](https://github.com/kumarshantanu/lein-exec) to `.lein/profiles.clj` before running scripts that this plugin generates.

Example:

    lein new script foo
    ./foo

You can easily add dependencies in the generated script by uncommenting the appropriate code within.
